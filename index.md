## Welcome to My Page

Hi, it's Favio, and I'm a software engineer based in Paris with a passion for the Java programming language. Do you want to work together or if you have any question or suggestion regarding my work please don't hesitate to contact me to my [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/favio-tejada).

## Current Location

## My projects

### Identity Access Management(IAM) Web Application

One of the project that I enjoyed the most not only because of the challenge of integrating multiple tools and frameworks, but also because it represented a valuable starting point for what I would be using as a Java programmer for my future career.

For more details see the [project source code on Github](https://github.com/tejada7/Java_IAM_Project).

### My first website

Along with a classmate we've developed a web site for a [tourism agency](http://www.boliviaexpedition.com/) from our hometown.  
Technologies involved:

## About me

After obtaining my CS bachelor's degree in 2014 I moved to the multi-cultural and impressive Paris where I studied a graduate program in Software Engineering. Later on I joined a multi-national IT consulting company where I literally had the time of my life career-wise.

I enjoy working on challenging projects that require high demand of intellectual and technical assets, combining effective communication skills and determination to achieve a shared goal.

During my spare time I love practicing sports, playing videogames and watching Roger Federer's matches.
